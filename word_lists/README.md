### Process Code
We applied filtering and deduplication steps for the **English** and **Chinese**. For **English_Simple** and **CommonsenseQA**, we curated and adapted the data specifically for our benchmark.

You can find the corresponding processing scripts in the repository. Feel free to modify them to implement custom filtering or adapt them to your own datasets.
